# Final Project Plan
I will be doing the Open-ended Project.

The plan for my project is to make a chess server, that can handle at least two clients. The server is going to be designed in a way where people can make their own clients using an API of some sort, and the server will handle logic and rule following. This will involve probably using sockets, multiple classes, etc.

Each type of piece will have it's own class, which will be a child of the piece base class. There will be multiple methods for checking if a move is legal or not. There will be options for the clients to get information about the current state of the board. There are additional things that might be included, but those are for if I have time.
